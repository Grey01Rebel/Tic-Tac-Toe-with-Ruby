# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-Ruby

## Overview
This is a simple **command-line Tic Tac Toe game** written in Ruby.  
The project was built as part of my learning journey in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** with Ruby.  

Two players can take turns placing their markers (`X` and `O`) on a 3x3 board until one wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features
- Two human players take turns.
- The board updates after every move.
- The game checks for a win or draw condition after each turn.
- Clear, easy-to-read code written using Ruby classes and methods.

## How It Works
- The game has three main classes:
  - **Player**: Stores each playerâ€™s name and marker (`X` or `O`).
  - **Board**: Handles the 3x3 grid, placing markers, and displaying the board.
  - **Game**: Controls the game flow, switches turns, and checks for winners or draws.

## Running the Game
1. Clone or download this project.  
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.  
3. Run:
   ```bash
   ruby main.rb
